# JAVASCRIPT-UnderTheHood

|Javascript| Description |
|-----|-----|
|| A single-threaded language |
|| MEANING |
|  |Runs one code at a time |
|| Results: Blocking code |
|Currying|break down of a function with multiple arguments into a series of functions each with 1 argument|
|Hoisting| By allocating memory to save the names of declared variables and functions (hoisted 1st) |
|| and then hoisting/'raising' them to the top of their current scope prior to execution |
|Hoisting order| function delcaration -> function expression -> variables |
|Concurrency Model||
|Event Loop| helps emulate concurrency by running asychronous or non blocking code |
| | Result: Manages code execution |
| Event Loop Parts: | Memory Heap, Call Stack, Event Queue, Event Loop and Node or Web APIs|
|| Function: Maintain the order of code execution | 
|Asynchronous| ability to do multiple tasks at same time|
|non blocking code| not stopping the other parts of the program from runnning while it completes a task|
|Memory |Management|
|Debugging|Memory|

|Memory Management ||
|-----|-----|
|Memory Heap| Unordered storage of objects and variables|
|Call Stack | tracks the currently running function |
|| and records at what point in time a function was executing.|
|Event Queue| holds messages of functions waiting processing and added back to stack|
|Event Loop|checks the call stack, IF IT'S EMPTY:|  
||get oldest callback (message) from the queue|
||push it into the call stack |
||call stack executes the callback|
|Node or Web APIs||
|Data structures used for memory storage | The Heap|
|| The Call Stack |
|Function| memory stores different Data Types |


The Event Loop can be summarized as: when code is executed, it is handled by the heap and call stack, which interact with Node and Web APIs. <br> 
Those APIs enable concurrency and pass asynchronous messages back to the stack via an event queue. <br>
The event queueâ€™s interaction with the call stack is managed by an event loop.<br>


#### THE STACK
Static storage<br>
Where Data size fixed<br>
Allocates fixed data so Ordered <br>
STORED DATA TYPES: <br>
Primitive types - number, string, boolean, undefined, null, variables.<br>
When a varible is created the stack stores the address for the variable with a value<br>
If the value is changed to the variable it will now point to a different address and different value.<br>

#### THE HEAP
Dynamic memory allocation at runtime <br>
Where Data size not fixed so UnOrdered<br>
STORED DATA TYPES:<br>
Reference types (instances) - Object literals, Arrays, Functions, etc <br>
Values are stored in the Heap so they can change when they are reassigned.<br>
The stack contains a reference address to the value in the HEAP.<br>

Declare a new variable newEmp = emp, the new object POINTS to the ADDRESS of the original object, and its values.<br> 
If new object value changes , it will change the original values.<br>
Why? The new variable newEmp (not a new object) it only points to the address of original object values, so mutate one will mutate the other.<br>

***So*** the Heap tells JavaScript where to find objects/functions BY the REFERENCES IN THE STACK.<br>
        
        const cat = {                   CAT `STORED IN HEAP`
            name: "Jupiter"                 A REFERENCE IS STORED IN STACK AND
        }                                       THE NAME PROPERTY IS `STORED IN STACK`


###### ***NOTE*** 
---> VARIABLE NAMES take up memory in the STACK<BR>
---> FUNCITON DEFINITION and OBJECTS have memory in the HEAP.<BR>

#### The Memory Life Cycle
3 parts:<br>

1. Memory Allocation (Values declared and stored then allocated) <br>
           * When function executed memory allocated <br>
           * Function frame added to stack <br> 
           * New objects stored in heap <br>
           * Stack stores reference to new object <br>
           * Function completed then removed from stack <br>
           * Memory is delocated and can be reused. <br>
           * STACK no longer have reference to Object stored in HEAP <br>
           * Objects are passed in a function by reference which can be modified in a function thus modifiying original object <br>
3. Memory in Use (Values read or rewritten) <br>
4. Releasing Memory (Values no longer used are removed from memory). <br>


           let aaliyah = {                                    //object created
                   name: "Aaliyah"                                //Saved into HEAP
           }                                                  //Reference in STACK
                        
           function nameObjectModification(obj, name) {               
                   obj.name = name;                    //Function used to create Oblect which still 
                   return obj;                            //references the original object aaliyah 
           }
                        
           let sarah = nameObjectModification(aaliyah, "Sarah");
                      //1st create Sarah object with nambObjectModification Referenced to aaliyah object
                          // then saved to new variable sarah Both variables reference same object 
               
           console.log(aaliyah); // { name: 'Sarah' }
           console.log(sarah); // { name: 'Sarah' }

#### Memory in Use

* Variable reassignment <br>
* Using variables <br>
* Passing arguments to functions <br>

#### Garbage Collection

- The process of clearing memory<br>
- JavaScript uses 2 algorithms for Garbage Collection<br>

                 1. REFERENCE COUNTING
                          Eg. Create an object - reference count = 1
                              Create another varaible point to same object - reference count = 2
                              A function uses the object - reference count = 3
                               Function finished then elements are garbage collected # of references = 0
                                          Memory block also = 0 and now utilize it for other storage
                            
                 2. MEMORY SWEEPING
                          - Periodically run starting at the root (global object)
                          - Sweeps by finding and marking elements
                          - Unmarked elements are garbage collected

  #### Memory Leaks

  - Memory no longer needed is not released. <br>
  - When garbage collection fails to find an object that lost its connection to the root object, or when objects grow in size and are referenced by other objects.<br>
  - Some functions which reference other objects keep objects in memory even though. <br>

            1. Messy Closure
                A combination of functions bundled together (enclosed) with REFERENCES to its surrounding state.
            2. Dangling Timers and Event Listeners
                Leak occurs when can't clear a continually running function
                    - FIX - assign function to a variable which can be cleared as needed 
            3. Circular References
                When 2 objects have pointers referencing each other. Their reference counts would be 2 each
                    - mark and sweep fixes this
    
#### Declaring Variables on the Global Object

  - Declare variables properly<br>
  - Global variables are available from the root so never garbage collected.<br>
  - Strict-mode helps keep global scope clean<br>

#### Performaces Issues can be caused by 

- Frequency of garbage collection <br>
- High object churn causes frequent garbage collection --> slows programs.<br>

#### Closures
-  A closure a function and its lexical environment (function/variables/data declared).
   

                function makeFunc() {
                    const name = "Mozilla";
                    function displayName() {
                      console.log(name);
                    }
                    return displayName;
                 }
                
                const myFunc = makeFunc();
                myFunc();


Eg. myFunc is a reference to displayName. The reference is created when makeFunc is called. <br>
DisplayName maintains a reference to its lexical environment <br>
myFunc = invoked, the variable name remains available for use, and "Mozilla" is passed to console.log. <br>
