# JAVASCRIPT-UnderTheHood

|Javascript| Description |
|-----|-----|
|Javascript| is a single-threaded language |
| Means |canâ€™t executed 2 statements simultaneously|
| Must run one code then run another code| Results: Blocking code |
|Currying||
|Hoisting| By allocating memory to save the names of declared variables and functions (hoisted 1st) |
|| and then hoisting/'raising' them to the top of their current scope prior to execution |
|Hoisting order| function delcaration -> function expression -> variables |
|Concurrency Model||
|Event Loop| helps run non blocking code|
| Result:| event loop helps emulate concurrency in javascript to manage code execution |
| Event Loop Parts: | Memory Heap, Call Stack, Event Queue, Event Loop and Node or Web APIs|
|Their Funciton: | Maintain the order of code execution when we run asynchronous functions |

|Memory Management||

Memory Heap - Unordered storage of objects and variables
Call Stack - tracks currently run function
Event Queue
Event Loop
Node or Web APIs
